# Introduction

Welcome to OpenGL Tutorials. I've tried to explain everything as clearly as I can. My aim is to teach you the basic of OpenGL
with clear examples. At the end of the each section, there is an **exercise** which you should solve before continuing to next
section.

## Prerequisites
Since OpenGL is a graphic API, and doesn't have a platform of its own, it requires a language to operate with. Here, we will be using
[QB64](http://www.qb64.net/). So, if you don't have much experience, I recommend you to learn it from [Qb64 Source Code](http://www.qb64sourcecode.com) or [School Freeware](http://www.schoolfreeware.com/QBasic_Tutorials_-_QB64_Tutorials_-_Programming_And_Code_Examples.html).

# Site structure
To make the tutorials easier to follow and give them some added structure, the site contains boxes, code blocks and keyword references. 

## Boxes
<div class="hint-box">
  <b>Green Boxes</b> contain some note or useful feature/hints about the OpenGL.
</div>
<div class="warning-box">
  <b>Red Boxes</b> contain warnings.
</div>

## Code
You will see plenty of small pieces of code on the site. They are highlighted in light gray as -

```vb
'A of the code
'Another line of code
```

## OpenGL Keyword References
You can hover on the OpenGL keywords to see information and syntax about it.
For example, try to hover on this - 
<span id="keyword-info" keyword-title="_glClear">
   _glClear clear buffers to preset values. <br><br>
  <i>Syntax - </i><br><br>
  <i>_glClear mask</i><br><br>
  mask: can be <i>_GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</i> or <i>_GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</i>.<br>
</span>
